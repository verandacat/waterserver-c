**Permalinks Customizer** helps you to set the different permalink structure for different PostTypes and Taxonomies which are publicly available.

You can use the tags which are defined by the WordPress as mentioned [here](https://github.com/yasglobal/permalinks-customizer#default-tags-for-posttypes). Also, you can use the tags which are customily defined by this plugin for [PostTypes](https://github.com/yasglobal/permalinks-customizer#custom-tags-for-posttypes) and [Taxonomies](https://github.com/yasglobal/permalinks-customizer#custom-tags-for-taxonomies). You can also find these tags in Permalinks Customizer menu on WordPress Dashboard (if the plugin is installed).

== How to set the Permalinks for different PostTypes ==

Let's assume that you have 6 **PostTypes** and you like to apply differnet **permalink** structure for them. Like:

1. **Blog :** For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/blog/year-month-date-postname/
2. **Customers :** For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/customers/postname/
3. **Events :** For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/events/year-month-date-postname/
4. **Press :** For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/press/category/year/postname/
5. **News :** For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/news/year/postname/
6. **Sponsors :** For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/company/sponsor/post_title/

This plugin allows you to do this very easily. You just need to go on **Permalinks Customizer** Settings Page. Where text fields are shown with PostType name. You can define your permalinks you want to create for each post type.

If you leave any PostType field empty, **Permalinks Customizer** will create a permalink for that PostType by using the default **permalink** settings.

== How to Configure Permalinks Customizer ==
You can configure the plugin by navigating to the `Permalinks Customizer` menu from the WordPress Dashboard

== Structure Tags ==
You can find all the tags which are currently supported by the `Permalinks Customizer`.

=== Default Tags for PostTypes ===
Below mentioned tags are provided by the `WordPress`. These tags can be used on Default `WordPress Permalink` Settings Page as well as `Permalinks Customizer` Settings page.

1. `%year%`:  The year of the post, four digits, for example 2019.
2. `%monthnum%`: Month of the year, for example 01.
3. `%day%`: Day of the month, for example 02.
4. `%hour%`: Hour of the day, for example 15.
5. `%minute%`: Minute of the hour, for example 43.
6. `%second%`: Second of the minute, for example 33.
7. `%post_id%`: The unique ID of the post, for example 123.
8. `%postname%`: A sanitized version of the title of the post (post slug field on Edit Post/Page panel). So "This Is A Great Post!" becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI.
9. `%category%`: A sanitized version of the category name (category slug field on New/Edit Category panel). Nested sub-categories appear as nested directories in the URI.
10. `%author%`: A sanitized version of the author name.

=== Custom Tags for PostTypes ===
Below mentioned tags are provided by the `Permalinks Customizer` for PostTypes. These tags can not be used on the Default `WordPress Permalink` Settings Page.

1. `%title%`: Title of the post. let's say the title is "This Is A Great Post!" so, it becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI.
2. `%parent_postname%`: This tag is similar as `%postname%`.<br><br> Only difference is that it appends Immediate **Parent Page Slug** if any parent page is selected before publishing.
3. `%child-category%`: A sanitized version of the category name (category slug field on New/Edit Category panel).
4. `%product_cat%`: A sanitized version of the product category name (category slug field on New/Edit Category panel). Nested sub-categories appear as nested directories in the URI.<br><br> *This `tag` is specially used in WooCommerce Products.*
5. `<%ctax_custom_taxonomy%>`: A sanitized version of the custom taxonomy where the taxonomy name is `custom_taxonomy`. Replace the `custom_taxonomy` with your appropriate created taxonomy name.<br><br> If you want to provide the default slug which is used when the category/taxonomy doesn't be selected so, make sure to provide default name/slug which looks like this: `<%ctax_custom_taxonomy??sales%>`. Value which is written between the `??` and `%>` is used as default slug.
6. `<%ctaxparents_custom_taxonomy%>`: This tag is similar as `<%ctax_custom_taxonomy%>`.<br><br> Only difference is that it appends all the parent slugs of the selected category/term.
7. `%author_firstname%`: A sanitized version of the author first name. If author first name is not available so, it uses the author's username.
8. `%author_lastname%`: A sanitized version of the author last name. If author last name is not available so, it uses the author's username.

**Note**: `%title%` is similar as `%postname%` tag but the difference is that `%postname%` can only be set once by WordPress whereas `%title%` can be changed by user at multiple times. let's say the title is "This Is A Great Post!" so, it becomes "this-is-a-great-post" in the URI(At the first time, `%postname%` and `%title%` works same) but if you edit and change title let's say "This Is A WordPress Post!" so, `%postname%` in the URI remains same "this-is-a-great-post" whereas `%title%` in the URI becomes "this-is-a-wordpress-post"

=== Custom Tags for Taxonomies ===
Below mentioned tags are provided by the `Permalinks Customizer` for Taxonomies. These can not be used on the Default `WordPress Permalink` Settings Page.

1. `%name%`: Name of the Term/Category. let's say the name is "External API" so, it becomes external-api in the URI.
2. `%term_id%`: The unique ID # of the Term/Category, for example 423
3. `%slug%`: A sanitized version of the name of the Term/Category. So "External API" becomes external-api in the URI.
4. `%parent_slug%`: A sanitized version of the name of the Term/Category. So "External API" becomes external-api in the URI. This Tag contains Immediate Parent Term/Category Slug if any parent Term/Category is selected before adding it.
5. `%all_parents_slug%`: A sanitized version of the name of the Term/Category. So "External API" becomes external-api in the URI. This Tag contains all the Parent Term/Category Slug if any parent Term/Category is selected before adding it.
